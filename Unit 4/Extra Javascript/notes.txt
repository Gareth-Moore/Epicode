> - The child operator. It is used to create a parent-child relationship between two elements. For example, div>p creates a div element that contains a p element as a child.
+ - The sibling operator. It is used to create siblings of the previous element. For example, div+p creates a div element, followed by a p element as a sibling of the div.
^ - The climb-up operator. It is used to move up the hierarchy of elements. For example, div>ul>li^ creates a div element with a child ul element that contains a li element, and then moves up one level to create another li element that is a sibling of the first li.
* - The multiplication operator. It is used to create multiple copies of an element. For example, li*3 creates three li elements.
() - The grouping operator. It is used to group elements together. For example, (div>p)+ul>li*3 creates a div element that contains a p element, followed by a ul element that contains three li elements.
[] - The attribute operator. It is used to add attributes to an element. For example, a[href=#] creates an a element with an href attribute set to #.
# - The ID operator. It is used to set the id attribute of an element. For example, div#my-div creates a div element with an id attribute set to my-div.
. - The class operator. It is used to set the class attribute of an element. For example, div.my-class creates a div element with a class attribute set to my-class.
$ - The numbering operator. It is used to create a sequence of numbered elements. For example, ul>li.item$*3 creates a ul element that contains three li elements with class names item1, item2, and item3, respectively.
@ - The text operator. It is used to add text content to an element. For example, a[href=#]@Click me! creates an a element with an href attribute set to # and the text content "Click me!".
{} and $ - The expression operator. It is used to evaluate expressions and insert their results into an abbreviation. For example, div{$1}*{$2} creates a div element with text content that is dynamically generated based on two input values.
^ - The fuzzy search operator. It is used to search for elements using a fuzzy search algorithm. For example, li^ matches the first li element that is a sibling of the current element, regardless of its position in the document tree.
* - The repeated text operator. It is used to repeat a text string a certain number of times. For example, p{Lorem ipsum}*3 creates three p elements, each with the text "Lorem ipsum".
$ - The placeholder operator. It is used to define a placeholder that can be replaced with custom content. For example, div>${1:content} creates a div element with a placeholder that can be replaced with custom content.
# - The counter operator. It is used to create a counter that can be incremented or decremented. For example, div.item-$*3 creates three div elements with class names "item-1", "item-2", and "item-3", respectively.
